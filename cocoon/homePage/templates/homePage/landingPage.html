              <h2>1) Complete our smart survey detailing your every need!</h2>
                <p>Take our smart survey to tell our computers what you need and what you want. This allows our
                    first-in-class algorithms to curate the best apartments for you on-market, like a robot wine
                    sommelier for apartments. We only use the finest databases, and all our listings are landlord- or
                    broker-validated, so you never have to worry about bait-and-switches or scam listings.</p>
                    <p>The computer assigns a score (0-100) for each viable property according to how ideal the
                        property is for you. The higher the score, the better-matched our computers think that property
                        is for you.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes your survey will return very few, no, or poorly rated properties. In this case, don’t
                        worry! Because Cocoon automatically pulls the best and freshest validated data available
                        anywhere, this just means that there truly isn’t anything trustworthy on-market.
                        If you’re in a pinch to move, this means you should relax some constraints to help increase
                        the pool of viable properties; otherwise, if you’re searching with more time, we recommend
                        signing up for our auto-compute feature, where the computer will study the market and notify
                        you when a well-matched property becomes available.</p>

              <h2>2) See your favorites with an expert tour guide.</h2>
                <p>Once you’re ready to see some properties in person (or over a video call), we automatically
                    calculate the best route for the properties you’ve chosen, schedule the tour for you on a day
                    and time that’s convenient for you, and ready an expert licensed affiliated real estate agent to
                    be your personal tour guide.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re out of town and still want to tour, our tour guides can also accommodate remote video
                    touring via FaceTime or Skype- just let them know your preference when they reach out to you on
                    their introductory call a few days before your tour.
                </p>
                <p>The tour itself will be of the properties you chose to visit- sometimes one or more of these gets
                    rented out quickly before you get a chance to tour them. In this case, our tour guides will set
                    up backup properties for you to see to make sure you get a good, thorough tour.
                </p>
                <p>Once you go on the tour, hopefully you’re ready to apply on a property! At this point we’ll reach
                    out to you to work with you on understanding the process and paperwork to lock in your property.

                <p>We’re so much more than Zillow; once you’ve decided on the dream place, Cocoon makes it super easy
                    for you to apply and win the apartment by making several vital steps available to you instantly
                    via our digital platform: from instant digitized paperwork to on-demand live customer service, we
                    make sure that every step of your apartment-getting journey is as simple and stress free as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Traditionally, the transference of money in a rental transaction is complicated and confusing. We
                    do our best to make it easy, by having 24-7 available advisors to help you (they can be reached
                    at that little turquoise circle in the bottom-right of your page!) and by advocating for super
                    transparent prices.
